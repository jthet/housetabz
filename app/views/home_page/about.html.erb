      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-6 text-green-400 tracking-wider">How It All Started</h2>
      <p class="text-lg text-black leading-relaxed mb-12">HouseTabz was founded by a group of highly motivated and ambitious college students who experienced the challenges of shared living firsthand. Frustrated with the constant struggle of gathering money from roommates, they envisioned a solution that would simplify bill management and improve the dynamics within shared households.</p>

<p class="text-lg text-black leading-relaxed mb-6">HouseTabz introduces a seamless banking system. Users contribute to a shared fund for hassle-free transactions. Our exclusive debit card simplifies payments. In case of missed payments, HouseTabz steps in, with a nominal fee.</p>
<p class="text-lg text-black leading-relaxed mb-12">Houses are classified by payment punctuality, influencing fees. Timely payments lead to lower fees, fostering accountability and punctuality within the household.</p>
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-6 text-green-400 tracking-wider">Secure and Convenient Payments</h2>

HouseTabz uses Stripe as our trusted payment processor, guaranteeing a secure and seamless payment experience. Your financial information is protected, and you can rest assured that your payments are handled with the utmost care.</p>
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-6 text-green-400 tracking-wider">Strengthening Relationships</h2>

By eliminating the need for individual reimbursements, HouseTabz promotes a sense of unity and cooperation within the household. Roommates can easily track payments and ensure that everyone is contributing their fair share.</p>
